<h1><u> You&i Fitness</u> </h1>

<p>My first milestone project is a website for a studio gym that my sister owns.

The website has four pages in total. The first page provides a short introduction to my sister and the studio gym where she trains her clients. 
There is then a gallery page showing pictures of the gym and of Danielle with clients.
A contact page with a form allowing clients/potential customers to reach out and contact Danielle with any questions or enquiries about sessions.
The final page is a donwload page with a link to an example programme that is free to downlaod to anyone interested. 

<h2><u>UX</u></h2>

I used the five planes of UX to finalise the design and features of the website. 

<u>1. strategy plane</U><br>
For this I needed to make sure the website was relevant for the users, and that it put value back into the busines.
To start I ask my sister what she wanted in a website and how she wanted it to look. She answered that she wanted the website to 
look professional and appealing to customers. We decided to go with a color scheme that matched her logo so the webpage wasn't to 'busy' with all 
different colors. Another request was a way in which customers were able to contact Danielle without having to put her personal contact details 
online but something more professional than through Facebook. I added the 'contact' page with a form where customers can send enquiries to Danielle's
email address, she can then give out her mobile number privately.

After discussing and working with Danielles requirements I went to the users and asked them what they look for in a website for a gym.
The common answers I got were that it looks professional, is easy to use and shows pictures of the gym and some of its equipment. To match these requirements we have kept the 
navigation around the website to a simple navigation bar in the header of the page, and a 'gallery' page with pictures of the gym and the euqipment. 
An extra feature I added to enhance the users experience is a free downloadable programme for potential customers so they preview the style of workouts they would 
be getting before deciding to hire Danielle. 

<u>2. Scope Plane </u><br>
For this I needed to find what features and content requirements are needed. 
I worked with Danielle on this section, to ensure all features she needed were included. 
Features that were included are:
-links to social media 
-downloadable programme 
-pictures of the gym 
-contact form. 

<u>3. Structure plane </u> <br>
I wanted to make the structure consistent, visibly appealing, any easy to navigate. 
I used the same header and footer throughout all the pages of the wesbite, with Danielles' logo and slogan. The navigation bar 
is easy to use and the headings clearly instruct the user what they will find on the pages they link too. I kept the color scheme simple
and matched it to the logo with the buttons turning red when you hover over them. 

<u>4. Skeleton Plane </u> <br>
This concerns the user interaction on the website. I aksed potential users about their needs for a gyms website and their expectation 
for the interaction, I tried meeting these needs by making the wesbite clear and easy to use by preventing a website that it too busy 
and hard to find the information you need. The website also encourage user interaction with the form that allows them to directly contact 
Danielle and the free downladable programme too trial one of Danielles' workouts. I used progressive disclosure to reveal content over a number 
of pages instead of having all the information on one page. 

<u>5. Surface Plane </u> <br>
The final step was the surface plane i.e. the sites identity.
I used all the information i received from Danielle and potential users to design the website to try and meet everybodies
needs and requirements. <br>
<u>Please find the mockups of the website in the 'mockup' folder on Github. Made using Balsamiq.</u>


<h2><u>Features</u></h2>

<u>1. Navigation bar.</u>
Allows the users to easily work their way around the website with no confusion. <br>

<u>2.Font awesome icons.</u>
Made link to social meadia page by using icons that are known worldwide i.e. Facebook and instagram icons. Visually appealing
to users and clear it is a link as they turn red when you hover over them.<br>

<u>3.Contact Form.</u>
Included a contact form that will be linked to Danielles personal email address. Allows users  to easily contact and ask any questions without 
Danielle having to post her personal contact number online. <br>

<u>4. Download link.</u>
Added a free downladable programme for anyone interested. When clicked it will open a PDF document with an example workout.
Allows users to see the style of workouts that they will be doing. <br>

<h2><u>Technologies used</u></h2>
Within the website I used a number of different languages and external libraries to help with the styling, these being:<br>
<u>1.Bootstrap.</u>
An external library to help with the styling of the website and making it mobile resonsive. https://getbootstrap.com/ <br>

<u>2.CSS.</u>
I used an style sheet to style classes within the html documents of the websites. <br>

<u>3.Font awesome.</u>
I used icons from font awesome and then made them into links to make the website more visually appealing.https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery <br>

<u>4. Google fonts.</u>
I used the font 'coda' throughout the website to try and match the font in the logo. https://fonts.google.com/ <br>

<h2><u>Testing</u></h2>
To make sure the website works fully I ran tests on all the features of the website. <br>

I have tested all the font awesome links to make sure the _blank opens a new webpage. 
it is currently linked to the index page but will eventually lead to social media links. <br>

I have tested the contact form, if I dont fill out one of the rows a warning signs appears asking the user to 
fill out the form to continue. <br>

All the links in the navbar go to the correct page. The back space is not needed to navigate around the webiste.<br>

I then used the W3C html and css checker https://validator.w3.org on the code for each page of my website, I then fixed any errors.
Mainly being a </img> that was not needed, and <img> tags not having the "alt" attribute. 



<h2><u>Deployment:</h2></u>
I used GitHub as the local repository for my website. 
opening the terminal on cloud 9 and then commiting my pages to github, I made sure to commit any new work frequently to ensure
that no work was lost and  that it was all kept up-to-date. 

The code was then locally deployed by going into the settings on my repository and publishing the code to get a local link. https://cnridley.github.io/you-i/

<h2><u>Credits</h2></u>
The text and media for this wesbite was provided by Danielle, the owner of the gym. She also provided the inspriation 
to make the website.
